## Who is this guy?

👋  I'm a computer engineer that loves to solve problems and make really bad puns.

👨‍💻 *and*...? Oh, the back-*end*! I have experience coding with .NET, Unity, SQL, and with what I'm currently working with: Node.Js and Typescript
Besides that, AWS has really taken some time out of me so I like to consider myself an infra guy as well. I've dealt with Kubernetes (<3), SES, S3, Cognito, Dynamo, Dax, RDS, Athena, and a few others... 

🐶  Training Sky (<- puppy's name) is part of my every day and so is solving puzzles! Going to the gym to look like someone that is not sitting in a chair all day (:cry:) is also an everyday thing.

🌱  I've been trying to read and study more about personal growth and currently reading "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" which is so simple and yet mind-blowing at the same time.

Let's chat!
